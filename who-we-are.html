            <p>Does your vagina have something to say?
              Something she wants the world to know? We want to hear from you. We are looking for a narrative from women from all backgrounds, cultures, ages and countries. We invite you to send us a few lines of text about your experience of being in this world, in your body, with a vagina. 
              Your piece can spring from any source: a memory, a moment from your life, a dream a fantasy. It can be a note from your vagina to the world or it can be a note from you to her. Your text doesn’t have to be well-written or in a special form. It doesn’t have to be poetic but it can be that, too. What we ask for is your honesty.  
             Your narrative can be something you don’t ever want to tell anyone, yet you want
             other women to know.
             Everyday events, traumas, shocking - or sublime -experiences - we will accept and cherish anything you’ll give us.

        <p>
          
          After we receive an email with your written text (or voice recording), we will not contact you unless you specifically ask for it (your privacy is vital to us.) Therefore you will not hear back from us after you send in your work. We will choose six stories for our film. 
          
          Our animation will be explicit in nature. We want to make sure this is clear to you before you decide to send in your personal narrative. We won’t draw a flower to represent a vagina. We will draw a vagina. After your send your story in, you will have a one-week ‘cooling off’ period in which you can change your mind and withdraw it from submission. After one week has passed, your story is officially submitted. We ask this of you because the artist will pour weeks of time, love and attention into drawing your narrative to life.
